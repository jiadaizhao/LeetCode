# 634. Find the Derangement of An Array

Difficulty: Medium

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-derangement-of-an-array/description/

In combinatorial mathematics, a derangement is a permutation of the elements of a set, such that no element appears in its original position.

There's originally an array consisting of n integers from 1 to n in ascending order, you need to find the number of derangement it can generate.

Also, since the answer may be very large, you should return the output mod 10<sup>9</sup> + 7.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The original array is [1,2,3]. The two derangements are [2,3,1] and [3,1,2].
```
**Note:**
n is in the range of [1, 10<sup>6</sup>].
