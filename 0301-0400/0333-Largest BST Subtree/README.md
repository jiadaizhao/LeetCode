Difficulty: Medium

https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-bst-subtree/

Given a binary tree, find the largest subtree which is a Binary Search Tree (BST), where largest means subtree with largest number of nodes in it.

**Note:**  
A subtree must include all of its descendants.

   10 
   / \ 
  5  15 
 / \   \ 
1   8   7

Output: 3
