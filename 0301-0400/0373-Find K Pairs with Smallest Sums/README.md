# 373. Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums

Difficulty: Medium

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-pairs-with-smallest-sums/

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 sorted in ascending order and an integer k.

Define a pair (u,v) which consists of one element from the first array and one element from the second array.

Find the k pairs (u1,v1),(u2,v2) ...(uk,vk) with the smallest sums.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums1 = [1,7,11], nums2 = [2,4,6], k = 3
Output: [[1,2],[1,4],[1,6]] 
Explanation: The first 3 pairs are returned from the sequence: 
             [1,2],[1,4],[1,6],[7,2],[7,4],[11,2],[7,6],[11,4],[11,6]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums1 = [1,1,2], nums2 = [1,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,1],[1,1]
Explanation: The first 2 pairs are returned from the sequence: 
             [1,1],[1,1],[1,2],[2,1],[1,2],[2,2],[1,3],[1,3],[2,3]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3], k = 3
Output: [1,3],[2,3]
Explanation: All possible pairs are returned from the sequence: [1,3],[2,3]
```

**Constraints:**
* 1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 105
* -109 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 109
* nums1 and nums2 both are sorted in ascending order.
* 1 <= k <= 1000
