# 325. Maximum Size Subarray Sum Equals k

Difficulty: Medium

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-size-subarray-sum-equals-k/

Given an array nums and a target value k, find the maximum length of a subarray that sums to k. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

**Note:**  
The sum of the entire nums array is guaranteed to fit within the 32-bit signed integer range.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1, -1, 5, -2, 3], k = 3
Output: 4 
Explanation: The subarray [1, -1, 5, -2] sums to 3 and is the longest.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [-2, -1, 2, 1], k = 1
Output: 2 
Explanation: The subarray [-1, 2] sums to 1 and is the longest.
```
