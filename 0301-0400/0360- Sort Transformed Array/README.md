Difficulty: Medium

https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-transformed-array/

Given a sorted array of integers nums and integer values a, b and c. Apply a function of the form f(x) = ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c to each element x in the array.

The returned array must be in sorted order.

Expected time complexity: O(n)

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [-4,-2,2,4], a = 1, b = 3, c = 5
Output: [3,9,15,33]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [-4,-2,2,4], a = -1, b = 3, c = 5
Output: [-23,-5,1,7]
```
