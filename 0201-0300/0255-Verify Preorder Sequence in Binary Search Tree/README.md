# 255. Verify Preorder Sequence in Binary Search Tree

Difficulty: Medium

https://leetcode.com/problems/verify-preorder-sequence-in-binary-search-tree/

Given an array of numbers, verify whether it is the correct preorder traversal sequence of a binary search tree.

You may assume each number in the sequence is unique.

Consider the following binary search tree: 
```
     5
    / \
   2   6
  / \
 1   3
```

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [5,2,6,1,3]
Output: false
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: [5,2,1,3,6]
Output: true
```

Could you do it using only constant space complexity?
