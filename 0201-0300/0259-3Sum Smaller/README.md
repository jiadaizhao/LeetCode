# 259. 3Sum Smaller

Difficulty: Medium

https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-smaller/

Given an array of n integers nums and a target, find the number of index triplets i, j, k with 0 <= i < j < k < n that satisfy the condition nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [-2,0,1,3], and target = 2
Output: 2 
Explanation: Because there are two triplets which sums are less than 2:
             [-2,0,1]
             [-2,0,3]
```
