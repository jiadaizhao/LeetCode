# 287. Find the Duplicate Number

Difficulty: Medium

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/

Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

**Note:**
1. You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
2. You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
3. Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n<sup>2</sup>).
4. There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.
