# 291. Word Pattern II

Difficulty: Hard

https://leetcode.com/problems/word-pattern-ii/

Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty substring in str.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: pattern = "abab", str = "redblueredblue"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: pattern = pattern = "aaaa", str = "asdasdasdasd"
Output: true
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: pattern = "aabb", str = "xyzabcxzyabc"
Output: false
```

**Notes:**
You may assume both pattern and str contains only lowercase letters.
