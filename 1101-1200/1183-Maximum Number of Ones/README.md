# 1183. Maximum Number of Ones

Difficulty: Hard

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-ones/

Consider a matrix M with dimensions width * height, such that every cell has value 0 or 1, and any square sub-matrix of M of size sideLength * sideLength has at most maxOnes ones.

Return the maximum possible number of ones that the matrix M can have.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: width = 3, height = 3, sideLength = 2, maxOnes = 1
Output: 4
Explanation:
In a 3*3 matrix, no 2*2 sub-matrix can have more than 1 one.
The best solution that has 4 ones is:
[1,0,1]
[0,0,0]
[1,0,1]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: width = 3, height = 3, sideLength = 2, maxOnes = 2
Output: 6
Explanation:
[1,0,1]
[1,0,1]
[1,0,1]
```

**Constraints:**

* 1 <= width, height <= 100
* 1 <= sideLength <= width, height
* 0 <= maxOnes <= sideLength * sideLength
