Given a matrix mat where every row is sorted in increasing order, return the smallest common element in all rows.

If there is no common element, return -1.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: mat = [[1,2,3,4,5],[2,4,5,8,10],[3,5,7,9,11],[1,3,5,7,9]]
Output: 5
```

**Constraints:**

* 1 <= mat.length, mat[i].length <= 500
* 1 <= mat[i][j] <= 10^4
* mat[i] is sorted in increasing order.
