# 470. Implement Rand10() Using Rand7()

Difficulty: Medium

https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-rand10-using-rand7/

Given a function rand7 which generates a uniform random integer in the range 1 to 7, write a function rand10 which generates a uniform random integer in the range 1 to 10.

Do NOT use system's Math.random().

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 1
Output: [7]
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: 2
Output: [8,4]
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: 3
Output: [8,1,10]
``` 

**Note:**

1. rand7 is predefined.
2. Each testcase has one argument: n, the number of times that rand10 is called.

**Follow up:**

1. What is the expected value for the number of calls to rand7() function?
2. Could you minimize the number of calls to rand7()?
