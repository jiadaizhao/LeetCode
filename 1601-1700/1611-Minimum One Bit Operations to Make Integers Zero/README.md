# 1611. Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero

Difficulty: Hard

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-one-bit-operations-to-make-integers-zero/

Given an integer n, you must transform it into 0 using the following operations any number of times:

* Change the rightmost (0th) bit in the binary representation of n.
* Change the ith bit in the binary representation of n if the (i-1)th bit is set to 1 and the (i-2)th through 0th bits are set to 0.

Return the minimum number of operations to transform n into 0.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 0
Output: 0
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 3 is "11".
"11" -> "01" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.
"01" -> "00" with the 1st operation.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 6
Output: 4
Explanation: The binary representation of 6 is "110".
"110" -> "010" with the 2nd operation since the 1st bit is 1 and 0th through 0th bits are 0.
"010" -> "011" with the 1st operation.
"011" -> "001" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.
"001" -> "000" with the 1st operation.
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: n = 9
Output: 14
```

**Example 5:**
```
Input: n = 333
Output: 393
```

**Constraints:**

* 0 <= n <= 10^9
