# 98. Validate Binary Search Tree

Difficulty: Medium

https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/description/

Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Example 1:
```
    2
   / \
  1   3
```
Binary tree [2,1,3], return true.

Example 2:
```
    1
   / \
  2   3
```

Binary tree [1,2,3], return false.
