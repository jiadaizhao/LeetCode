# 1525. Number of Good Ways to Split a String

Difficulty: Medium

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-good-ways-to-split-a-string/

You are given a string s, a split is called good if you can split s into 2 non-empty strings p and q where its concatenation is equal to s and the number of distinct letters in p and q are the same.

Return the number of good splits you can make in s.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "aacaba"
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 5 ways to split "aacaba" and 2 of them are good. 
("a", "acaba") Left string and right string contains 1 and 3 different letters respectively.
("aa", "caba") Left string and right string contains 1 and 3 different letters respectively.
("aac", "aba") Left string and right string contains 2 and 2 different letters respectively (good split).
("aaca", "ba") Left string and right string contains 2 and 2 different letters respectively (good split).
("aacab", "a") Left string and right string contains 3 and 1 different letters respectively.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "abcd"
Output: 1
Explanation: Split the string as follows ("ab", "cd").
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "aaaaa"
Output: 4
Explanation: All possible splits are good.
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: s = "acbadbaada"
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

* s contains only lowercase English letters.
* 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
