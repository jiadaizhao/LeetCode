# 1582. Special Positions in a Binary Matrix

Difficulty: Easy

https://leetcode.com/problems/special-positions-in-a-binary-matrix/

Given a rows x cols matrix mat, where mat[i][j] is either 0 or 1, return the number of special positions in mat.

A position (i,j) is called special if mat[i][j] == 1 and all other elements in row i and column j are 0 (rows and columns are 0-indexed).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: mat = [[1,0,0],
              [0,0,1],
              [1,0,0]]
Output: 1
Explanation: (1,2) is a special position because mat[1][2] == 1 and all other elements in row 1 and column 2 are 0.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: mat = [[1,0,0],
              [0,1,0],
              [0,0,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: (0,0), (1,1) and (2,2) are special positions. 
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: mat = [[0,0,0,1],
              [1,0,0,0],
              [0,1,1,0],
              [0,0,0,0]]
Output: 2
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: mat = [[0,0,0,0,0],
              [1,0,0,0,0],
              [0,1,0,0,0],
              [0,0,1,0,0],
              [0,0,0,1,1]]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

* rows == mat.length
* cols == mat[i].length
* 1 <= rows, cols <= 100
* mat[i][j] is 0 or 1.
