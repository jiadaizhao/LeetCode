# 1504. Count Submatrices With All Ones

Difficulty: Medium

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-submatrices-with-all-ones/

Given a rows * columns matrix mat of ones and zeros, return how many submatrices have all ones.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: mat = [[1,0,1],
              [1,1,0],
              [1,1,0]]
Output: 13
Explanation:
There are 6 rectangles of side 1x1.
There are 2 rectangles of side 1x2.
There are 3 rectangles of side 2x1.
There is 1 rectangle of side 2x2. 
There is 1 rectangle of side 3x1.
Total number of rectangles = 6 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 13.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: mat = [[0,1,1,0],
              [0,1,1,1],
              [1,1,1,0]]
Output: 24
Explanation:
There are 8 rectangles of side 1x1.
There are 5 rectangles of side 1x2.
There are 2 rectangles of side 1x3. 
There are 4 rectangles of side 2x1.
There are 2 rectangles of side 2x2. 
There are 2 rectangles of side 3x1. 
There is 1 rectangle of side 3x2. 
Total number of rectangles = 8 + 5 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 24.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: mat = [[1,1,1,1,1,1]]
Output: 21
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: mat = [[1,0,1],[0,1,0],[1,0,1]]
Output: 5
```

**Constraints:**

* 1 <= rows <= 150
* 1 <= columns <= 150
* 0 <= mat[i][j] <= 1
