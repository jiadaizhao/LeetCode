# 1594. Maximum Non Negative Product in a Matrix

Difficulty: Medium

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-non-negative-product-in-a-matrix/

You are given a rows x cols matrix grid. Initially, you are located at the top-left corner (0, 0), and in each step, you can only move right or down in the matrix.

Among all possible paths starting from the top-left corner (0, 0) and ending in the bottom-right corner (rows - 1, cols - 1), find the path with the maximum non-negative product. The product of a path is the product of all integers in the grid cells visited along the path.

Return the maximum non-negative product modulo 10^9 + 7. If the maximum product is negative return -1.

Notice that the modulo is performed after getting the maximum product.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: grid = [[-1,-2,-3],
               [-2,-3,-3],
               [-3,-3,-2]]
Output: -1
Explanation: It's not possible to get non-negative product in the path from (0, 0) to (2, 2), so return -1.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: grid = [[1,-2,1],
               [1,-2,1],
               [3,-4,1]]
Output: 8
Explanation: Maximum non-negative product is in bold (1 * 1 * -2 * -4 * 1 = 8).
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: grid = [[1, 3],
               [0,-4]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Maximum non-negative product is in bold (1 * 0 * -4 = 0).
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: grid = [[ 1, 4,4,0],
               [-2, 0,0,1],
               [ 1,-1,1,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Maximum non-negative product is in bold (1 * -2 * 1 * -1 * 1 * 1 = 2).
```

**Constraints:**

* 1 <= rows, cols <= 15
* -4 <= grid[i][j] <= 4
