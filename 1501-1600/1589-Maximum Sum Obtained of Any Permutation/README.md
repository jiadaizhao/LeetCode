# 1589. Maximum Sum Obtained of Any Permutation

Difficulty: Medium

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-obtained-of-any-permutation/

We have an array of integers, nums, and an array of requests where requests[i] = [starti, endi]. The ith request asks for the sum of nums[starti] + nums[starti + 1] + ... + nums[endi - 1] + nums[endi]. Both starti and endi are 0-indexed.

Return the maximum total sum of all requests among all permutations of nums.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], requests = [[1,3],[0,1]]
Output: 19
Explanation: One permutation of nums is [2,1,3,4,5] with the following result: 
requests[0] -> nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[3] = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8
requests[1] -> nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 1 = 3
Total sum: 8 + 3 = 11.
A permutation with a higher total sum is [3,5,4,2,1] with the following result:
requests[0] -> nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[3] = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11
requests[1] -> nums[0] + nums[1] = 3 + 5  = 8
Total sum: 11 + 8 = 19, which is the best that you can do.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6], requests = [[0,1]]
Output: 11
Explanation: A permutation with the max total sum is [6,5,4,3,2,1] with request sums [11].
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,10], requests = [[0,2],[1,3],[1,1]]
Output: 47
Explanation: A permutation with the max total sum is [4,10,5,3,2,1] with request sums [19,18,10].
```

**Constraints:**

* n == nums.length
* 1 <= n <= 10^5
* 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
* 1 <= requests.length <= 10^5
* requests[i].length == 2
* 0 <= starti <= endi < n
