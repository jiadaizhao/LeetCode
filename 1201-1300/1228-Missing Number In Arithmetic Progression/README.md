Difficulty: Easy

https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number-in-arithmetic-progression/

In some array arr, the values were in arithmetic progression: the values arr[i+1] - arr[i] are all equal for every 0 <= i < arr.length - 1.

Then, a value from arr was removed that was not the first or last value in the array.

Return the removed value.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr = [5,7,11,13]
Output: 9
Explanation: The previous array was [5,7,9,11,13].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: arr = [15,13,12]
Output: 14
Explanation: The previous array was [15,14,13,12].
```

**Constraints:**

* 3 <= arr.length <= 1000
* 0 <= arr[i] <= 10^5
