# 1492. The kth Factor of n

Difficulty: Medium

https://leetcode.com/problems/the-kth-factor-of-n/

Given two positive integers n and k.

A factor of an integer n is defined as an integer i where n % i == 0.

Consider a list of all factors of n sorted in ascending order, return the kth factor in this list or return -1 if n has less than k factors.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 12, k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12], the 3rd factor is 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 7, k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 7], the 2nd factor is 7.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 4, k = 4
Output: -1
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 4], there is only 3 factors. We should return -1.
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: Factors list is [1], the 1st factor is 1.
```

**Example 5:**
```
Input: n = 1000, k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 125, 200, 250, 500, 1000].
```

**Constraints:**

* 1 <= k <= n <= 1000
