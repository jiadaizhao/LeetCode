# 1477. Find Two Non-overlapping Sub-arrays Each With Target Sum

Difficulty: Medium

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-two-non-overlapping-sub-arrays-each-with-target-sum/

Given an array of integers arr and an integer target.

You have to find two non-overlapping sub-arrays of arr each with a sum equal target. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is minimum.

Return the minimum sum of the lengths of the two required sub-arrays, or return -1 if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr = [3,2,2,4,3], target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Only two sub-arrays have sum = 3 ([3] and [3]). The sum of their lengths is 2.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: arr = [7,3,4,7], target = 7
Output: 2
Explanation: Although we have three non-overlapping sub-arrays of sum = 7 ([7], [3,4] and [7]), but we will choose the first and third sub-arrays as the sum of their lengths is 2.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: arr = [4,3,2,6,2,3,4], target = 6
Output: -1
Explanation: We have only one sub-array of sum = 6.
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: arr = [5,5,4,4,5], target = 3
Output: -1
Explanation: We cannot find a sub-array of sum = 3.
```

**Example 5:**
```
Input: arr = [3,1,1,1,5,1,2,1], target = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Note that sub-arrays [1,2] and [2,1] cannot be an answer because they overlap.
```

**Constraints:**

* 1 <= arr.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* 1 <= arr[i] <= 1000
* 1 <= target <= 10<sup>8</sup>
