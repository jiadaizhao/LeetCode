# 1441. Build an Array With Stack Operations

Difficulty: Easy

https://leetcode.com/problems/build-an-array-with-stack-operations/

Given an array target and an integer n. In each iteration, you will read a number from  list = {1,2,3..., n}.

Build the target array using the following operations:

* Push: Read a new element from the beginning list, and push it in the array.
* Pop: delete the last element of the array.
* If the target array is already built, stop reading more elements.

Return the operations to build the target array. You are guaranteed that the answer is unique.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: target = [1,3], n = 3
Output: ["Push","Push","Pop","Push"]
Explanation: 
Read number 1 and automatically push in the array -> [1]
Read number 2 and automatically push in the array then Pop it -> [1]
Read number 3 and automatically push in the array -> [1,3]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: target = [1,2,3], n = 3
Output: ["Push","Push","Push"]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: target = [1,2], n = 4
Output: ["Push","Push"]
Explanation: You only need to read the first 2 numbers and stop.
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: target = [2,3,4], n = 4
Output: ["Push","Pop","Push","Push","Push"]
```

**Constraints:**

* 1 <= target.length <= 100
* 1 <= target[i] <= n
* 1 <= n <= 100
* target is strictly increasing.
