# 1499. Max Value of Equation

Difficulty: Hard

https://leetcode.com/problems/max-value-of-equation/

You are given an array points containing the coordinates of points on a 2D plane, sorted by the x-values, where points[i] = [xi, yi] such that xi < xj for all 1 <= i < j <= points.length. You are also given an integer k.

Return the maximum value of the equation yi + yj + |xi - xj| where |xi - xj| <= k and 1 <= i < j <= points.length.

It is guaranteed that there exists at least one pair of points that satisfy the constraint |xi - xj| <= k.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: points = [[1,3],[2,0],[5,10],[6,-10]], k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: The first two points satisfy the condition |xi - xj| <= 1 and if we calculate the equation we get 3 + 0 + |1 - 2| = 4. Third and fourth points also satisfy the condition and give a value of 10 + -10 + |5 - 6| = 1.
No other pairs satisfy the condition, so we return the max of 4 and 1.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: points = [[0,0],[3,0],[9,2]], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Only the first two points have an absolute difference of 3 or less in the x-values, and give the value of 0 + 0 + |0 - 3| = 3.
```

**Constraints:**

* 2 <= points.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* points[i].length == 2
* -10<sup>8</sup> <= xi, yi <= 10<sup>8</sup>
* 0 <= k <= 2 * 10<sup>8</sup>
* xi < xj for all 1 <= i < j <= points.length
* xi form a strictly increasing sequence.
