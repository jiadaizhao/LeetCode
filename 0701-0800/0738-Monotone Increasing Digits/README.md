Difficulty: Medium

https://leetcode.com/problems/monotone-increasing-digits/

Given a non-negative integer N, find the largest number that is less than or equal to N with monotone increasing digits.

(Recall that an integer has monotone increasing digits if and only if each pair of adjacent digits x and y satisfy x <= y.)

**Example 1:**
```
Input: N = 10
Output: 9
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: N = 1234
Output: 1234
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: N = 332
Output: 299
```
**Note:** N is an integer in the range [0, 10^9].
