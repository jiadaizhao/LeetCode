https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator-iii/description/

Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string may contain open ( and closing parentheses ), the plus + or minus sign -, non-negative integers and empty spaces .

The expression string contains only non-negative integers, +, -, *, / operators , open ( and closing parentheses ) and empty spaces . The integer division should truncate toward zero.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of [-2147483648, 2147483647].

Some examples:
```
"1 + 1" = 2
" 6-4 / 2 " = 4
"2*(5+5*2)/3+(6/2+8)" = 21
"(2+6* 3+5- (3*14/7+2)*5)+3"=-12
```

Note: Do not use the eval built-in library function.
