# 291. Word Pattern II

Difficulty: Hard

https://leetcode.com/problems/word-pattern-ii/description/

Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty substring in str.

**Examples:**
1. pattern = "abab", str = "redblueredblue" should return true.
2. pattern = "aaaa", str = "asdasdasdasd" should return true.
3. pattern = "aabb", str = "xyzabcxzyabc" should return false.

**Notes:**
You may assume both pattern and str contains only lowercase letters.
